   The application aims to display real-time system resources such as: CPU
usage, Memory Usage, Disk Space Usage, Battery Level and GPU, also the generated information is
saved to an output text file where the user can access and view this data.
Generated graphics can be saved in JPEG format.
   The project starts with the creation of a function where the variables required for display are defined
data in the system. For this I used the psutil module and the display made is below
the form of a loading bar initially generated in the console for testing the function's functionality.
  Refreshing the data was done by calling the function used and a
arguments in a while, where we defined a global variable alpha, also used for stopping
program from the graphical interface; the refresh time being set to one second.
  The next step was to write the information into a txt file and make the part
graphs. For this purpose, it was necessary to import the matplotlib and tkinter modules.
  The graphs were made in matplotlib, and then integrated into tkinter using
FiguresCanvasTkAgg.
  Four classes were created, the first being for opening the main window,
then the StartPage where I created navigation buttons between frames, but also a stop button
of the program.
  Back to Home buttons have been created to return to the main menu,
but also the button to go to Page Two, which opens the graphics viewing window
for disk. Through matplotlib the animations were created and later entered into
tkinter with the buttons generated from the initial display (save graphics as
jpeg).
